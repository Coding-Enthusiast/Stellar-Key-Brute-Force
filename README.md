**Update 2021**  
Use my other project [StellarCracker-NetCore](https://github.com/Coding-Enthusiast/StellarCracker-NetCore), it is targetting
.Net 5 so it can be used on any operating system including Linux.  
It also has an improved and optimized code that doesn't have the limitations of this project.

# Stellar-Key-Brute-Force
A simple console app for verifying stellar private keys.

This app will require a file named keys.txt to be located at c:\

The keys in this file need to be 1 key per line.

If it finds any valid key, the program will write a new file to same directory containing all the keys.
